<p class="message">
  Hey there! Thanks for looking at our site. It's not hard to build a site
  like this for your book group; a link to the source is provided below. 
  Any geek can do it.
</p>


<b>The Tampa Bay Book Group</b> is a private group of book-lovers 
who meet the second Tuesday of every month to discuss a
book. The discussion is moderated by an HCC
professor who generously volunteers her time to the
group.  Sorry, we are not currently looking for new members.  

Thanks for reading!

<h2>Building This Site</h2>
This website was built by <a href="http://www.thatsoftwareguy.com/">That Software Guy</a>, using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and the 
<a href="https://github.com/tokzk/jekyll-amazon">Jekyll::Amazon</a> gem.
<br /><br />
The source code for this site is available on Github.  You may use it as a template for <a href="https://github.com/scottcwilson/ort">building your book group website</a>.

<h2>Legacy Site</h2>
I used to maintain a site in static HTML with links to books created from 
the Associates Central linkbuilding page.  You can still 
<a href="http://thatsoftwareguy.com/old-ort/">see the old site</a>.
