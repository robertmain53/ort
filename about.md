<p class="message">
  Hey there! Thanks for looking at our site. It's not hard to build a site
  like this for your book group; the parts list is provided below. 
  Any geek can do it.
</p>


<b>The Tampa Bay Book Group</b> is a private group of book-lovers 
who meet the second Tuesday of every month to discuss a
book. The discussion is moderated by an HCC
professor who generously volunteers her time to the
group.  Sorry, we are not currently looking for new members.  

Thanks for reading!

<h2>Building This Site</h2>
The source code for my <a href="https://github.com/scottcwilson/ort">book group website</a> is available on Github.  You may use it as a template for building your own book group website. 

This website was built by <a href="http://www.thatsoftwareguy.com/">That Software Guy</a>, using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
